# Batman Arkham Knight Script Reader

---

## Description
Batman Arkham Knight Script Reader is a Java-based tool designed to read, analyze, and extract a play-by-play dialogue for one scene in the Batman: Arkham Knight video game. This project presents the **exact in-game script** as it appears, allowing users to experience or study the full narrative and dialogue as delivered in the original game. It is ideal for fans and modders who want to reference or explore the authentic Arkham Knight story in its true form.

## Inspiration
My inspiration for this project comes from my love for the Batman Arkham series games. I played all four games growing up and have always enjoyed Batman as a character. This project is a way to share that passion and make it easier for others to dive into the rich storytelling of Batman: Arkham Knight.
